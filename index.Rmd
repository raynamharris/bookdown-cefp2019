# Introduction

The [AAAS Community Engagement Fellows Program (CEFP)](https://www.aaas.org/programs/community-engagement-fellows), generously supported by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, aims to improve collaboration and community building in science. It provides a year-long professional development opportunity to individuals who cultivate member engagement and collaborative relationships within scientific associations, research collaborations and other communities of scientists. This book is a collection of blog posts that describe the experiences of many professional community managers. Their stories provide a wealth of knowlege that aspiring and practicing community managers can use.
